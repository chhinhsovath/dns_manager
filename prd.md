    I own domain openplp.org which is registered under my personal account via cloudflare.com.
    I have set up a Cloudflare account specifically for openplp.org to manage its DNS settings, DNSSEC, and other related services. My Host: 192.168.155.122 is configured to use this Cloudflare account for DNS management.

    I have one domain but i will have multiple subdomain like:
    - openplp.org points to 192.168.155.122:5055
    - www.openplp.org points to 192.168.155.122:5055
    - mel.openplp.org points to 192.168.155.122:5050    
    - blog.openplp.org points to 192.168.155.122:5051    
    - wiki.openplp.org points to 192.168.155.122:5052

    i will have many more domains and sub-domain, can you help me get opensource tools to flexible handle this tasks.
